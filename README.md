# About
My name is Connor Krenzer, and I am a data science analyst. I occasionally make programming tutorials and post them on YouTube.

# I use GitHub to Learn, Share, and Grow
Any repo made in 2020 or 2021 was created while in undergrad and may be hot messes! I will not remove them, however, as it's important to remember your humble beginnings. A few of those were essentially desperate pleas saying, *"Please hire me, I have used algorithm x before--I have a project portfolio to talk about!"*, in response to interviewers asking which algorithms I've used in the past. We've all been there. But it's good to have a sense of urgency. Messy as they are, I still appreciate that I took the time to fill everything up with comments and documentation. These days, I try to make my projects stay structured and organized!


# Fun Facts
1. My first ever line of code was written on January 27th, 2020. It was in R--though I started writing in Java later that week. I don't use Java much these days. R, my strongest language, was also my first!
1. Most of what I know in R is self-taught. My formal computer science training was all done in Java (and a tiny bit of C). Self-taught is a bit of a misnomer--much of my knowledge comes from my knowledge of data structures and Hadley Wickham's books.
1. I haven't met anyone from Wisconsin.
