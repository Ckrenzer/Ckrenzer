# I use GitHub to Learn, Share, and Grow
These days, I tend to work on projects that are interesting, facilitate learning, or help others.

I started using GitHub to practice programming and learn about Git.
As a result, there are quite a few low-quality repositories on my profile.
You will find those early repos that do not receive frequent updates in [ck-earlyrepos](https://github.com/ck-earlyrepos).
I will not hide them, however, as it's important to remember your humble beginnings.
