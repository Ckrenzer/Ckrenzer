# I use GitHub to Learn, Share, and Grow
I started using GitHub to practice programming and learn about Git.
As a result, there are quite a few low-quality repositories on my profile.
You will find those early repos that do not receive frequent updates in [ck-earlyrepos](https://github.com/ck-earlyrepos).
I will not hide them, however, as it's important to remember your humble beginnings.

These days, I tend to work on projects that are interesting, facilitate learning, or help others.
New projects stay structured and organized!


# Fun Facts
1. My first ever line of code was written on January 27th, 2020. It was in R--though I started writing in Java later that week. I don't use Java much these days. R, my strongest language, was also my first!
1. My formal computer science training was almost exclusively done in Java (and a touch of C), so most of what I know about other languages is self-taught. Self-taught is a bit of a misnomer--much of what I know comes from transferable knowledge of data structures, along with information from books and other resources.
1. I don't eat sweets.
