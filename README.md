NeoVim is my editor of choice.
While occasionally painful, it forces you to learn
about computers and how to improve your workflow.
Complaceny is a bad thing.

# I use GitHub to Learn, Share, and Grow
These days, I tend to work on projects that are interesting, facilitate learning, or help others.

I started using GitHub to practice programming and learn about Git.
I've continued using GitHub because it is an excellent platform to share
code and collaborate with others.
