# About
My name is Connor Krenzer, and I work in a data science role based in Atlanta. I occasionally make programming tutorials and post them on YouTube.

# I use GitHub to Learn, Share, and Grow
Repos started in 2020 or 2021 were created while in undergrad and may be hot messes! I will not remove them, however, as it's important to remember your humble beginnings. A few of those were essentially desperate pleas saying, *"Please hire me, I have used algorithm x before--I have a project portfolio to prove it!"*, in response to employers asking which algorithms I've used in the past. We've all been there. But it's good to have a sense of urgency. Messy as they are, I still appreciate that I took the time to fill the scripts up with comments and documentation.

These days, I tend to work on projects that are interesting, facilitate learning, or help others. New projects stay structured and organized!


# Fun Facts
1. My first ever line of code was written on January 27th, 2020. It was in R--though I started writing in Java later that week. I don't use Java much these days. R, my strongest language, was also my first!
1. My formal computer science training was almost exclusively done in Java (and a touch of C), so most of what I know about other languages is self-taught. Self-taught is a bit of a misnomer--much of what I know comes from transferable knowledge of data structures, along with books, such as those from Hadley Wickham, among other resources.
1. I haven't met anyone from Wisconsin.
